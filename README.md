# gpioExamples

requires npm packages:
sleep
onoff
readline

Few examples of usage of a gpio pin through use of the onoff package.

flash.js, takes 1 optional arg for number of millis. default if no arg provided is 500.

light.js, 1 required arg either "off" or "on". sets the pin (in this case pin4) to 1 or 0.
